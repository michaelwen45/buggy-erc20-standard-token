## Problems in ERC20 Token Contracts

[ERC20 standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) is one of the most popular Ethereum token standards [[1]](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md). As of June 26th, 2018, more than 95,000 ERC20 token smart contracts have been deployed according to [statistics from Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tokens). Here is a daily trend chart of ERC20 contracts created according to our statistics:

![ERC20 Contracts Created on main Ethereum network every day](img/erc20-creation.jpeg)

### Security Incidents in Smart Contracts

ERC20 Token specification has gone through challenges and improvements during its growth. Lots of critical security issues have been revealed,  some of which have led to severe financial losses [2-11] for developers, investors, even Ethereum community as well.

On June 18th, 2016, the DAO hack caused a total loss of over 3,600,000 ethers(ETH) worth over a billion dollars, and the Ethereum hard-fork afterwards led to the Ethereum community breaking apart [[2]](https://medium.com/@pullnews/understanding-the-dao-hack-for-journalists-2312dd43e993).

On April 22th, 2018, the attack on BeautyChain(BEC) contract hardly decreased the token price to zero via pouring astronomical tokens to exchanges through an integer overflow [[3]](https://medium.com/secbit-media/a-disastrous-vulnerability-found-in-smart-contracts-of-beautychain-bec-dbf24ddbc30e). There are 10 other contracts at least containing this problem.

On April 25th, 2018, a similar integer overflow got uncovered in SMT. Hackers minted and dumped a tremendous amount of tokens, resulting in SMT's collapse [[4]](https://smartmesh.io/2018/04/25/smartmesh-announcement-on-ethereum-smart-contract-overflow-vulnerability/). There is one other contract at least containing this problem.

On May 20th, 2018, a critical logical flaw was found in EDU along with other three Token contracts (CVE-2018–11397, CVE-2018–11398), causing that users' balances could be transferred out randomly [[5]](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/lf9vXcUxdB2fGY2YVTauRQ). After further analysis, we caught this bug in at least 81 contracts [[6]](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/9FMt_TBSb9avL78KEAXHuA).

On June 12, 2018, a series of overflow bug in ERC20 smart contracts got uncovered (CVE-2018-11687, CVE-2018-11809, CVE-2018-11810, CVE-2018-11811, CVE-2018-11812) [[7]](https://www.secrss.com/articles/3289). We have revealed more than 800 contracts with the same problem after scanning over 20,000 contracts deployed on Etherscan [[8]](http://www.chaindd.com/3083754.html).

### Failure of Satisfying Specification in Many ERC20 contracts

Lots of ERC20 token contracts do not follow the ERC20 standard strictly, which is troublesome to developers of DApps on ERC20 tokens [12-14].

Thousands of deployed Token contracts referred to incorrect example code on Ethereum official website and OpenZeppelin, resulting in several functions failing to meet ERC20 standard. After upgrading Solidity compiler to 0.4.22, incompatibilities would arise and these contracts could not perform normal transactions on decentralized exchanges (DEX) or DApp in most cases [[12]](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/an-incompatibility-in-smart-contract-threatening-dapp-ecosystem-72b8ca5db4da), whereas a majority of DApp developing teams were off guard and unaware of such a problem.

Several Token contracts added redundant checks in standard `approve()`, requiring that the approved \_amount smaller or equal to the current balance. However, it makes DEX employing protocols like 0x hard to finish `approve()` in advance, asking the Token developing team transfer a huge amount of tokens to the exchange's intermediate account ahead which violates the target of employing ERC20 standard and brings about inconvenience.

Since it is defined optional to set common querying interfaces like `name()`, `symbol()` and `decimals()` in ERC20 specification [[1]](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md), many Token contracts left them out or named them differently, such as `NAME()`, `SYMBOL()` and `DECIMALS()`, making it harder for DEX and DApp developing.

Another point worth mentioning is that two events - `Transfer` and `Approval` should get fired under certain circumstances described by ERC20 specification [[1]](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md). In fact, many Token contracts left out `Approval` event referring to Ethereum official website [[14]](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org/pull/865). This omission causes great difficulty for developers listening to relevant events, undermining the development of DApp ecosystem.

### One Solution: Collecting Buggy Token Contracts

Statistical summaries from security organizations and experts indicate that critical vulnerabilities are hiding in smart contracts, taking the '*TOP 10 in 2018*' by NCC group [[15]](https://www.dasp.co/) as an example:

- Reentrancy
- Access Control
- Integer Overflow
- Unchecked Return Values For Low Level Calls
- Denial of Service
- Bad Randomness
- Front-Running
- Time manipulation
- Short Address Attack
- Unknown Unknowns

This might be just the tip of an iceberg. Recent research together with the aforementioned point of view state clearly that the scale of problems in smart contracts deployed on Ethereum may go beyond our imagination.

We made a collection of past bugs and vulnerabilities, including:

1. vulnerabilities in Token contracts
2. incompatibilities due to inconsistency with ERC20
3. excessive authorities of Token administrators [[16]](https://medium.com/@peckshield/highly-manipulatable-erc20-tokens-identified-in-multiple-top-exchanges-including-binance-d158deab4b9a)

## Why This Repo?

There are many projects in Ethereum community contributing to the ecosystem of smart contracts, such as '*A guide to smart contract security best practices*' [[17]](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices) maintained by Consensys and '*OpenZeppelin, a framework to build secure smart contracts on Ethereum*' [[18]](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity) developed by OpenZeppelin.

Also, we found the fact that a majority of issues in buggy Token contracts come from referring, copying and modifying others' code without caution. Also, using incorrect sample code is an origin of bugs. It is difficult for beginners and developers of smart contracts to determine whether a contract snippet from main net contains bugs and identify these issues in seconds.

We would maintain this collection to:

- provide a reference and learning materials of common bugs in ERC20 token contracts
- help ERC20 token contract developers to develop correct and secure contracts
- notice DApp developers of incompatible/buggy/vulnerable ERC20 token contracts
- warn exchanges and investors of potential risks in incompatible/buggy/insecure ERC20 tokens

## What We Collect?

+ List of deployed buggy token contracts
